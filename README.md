# DPRun

DPRun is a standalone C Windows/Wine utility for starting DirectPlay lobbyable applications.

The idea is to have a small application that can handle the lobby setup, and exposes an API that a real lobby application can use to start games. This way a lobby application can run natively on eg. Linux and macOS, and only run the absolutely necessary bits in Wine.

By "small" I mean I hope this can be done well in something like 1000 lines.
